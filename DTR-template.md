# DTR For:
* Sue, Josh, and Tyler.
* Any changes to this can be decided by the group as a whole.

## Agreed Schedule:    
* Each day after class  we begin after one hour pom.
* We do not work on Friday.    
* We will work for at least two hours and then continue to communicate if we need more or less time.  
* Latest we work is 830.  
* If stuck on a problem for 45 we break and look elsewhere for answers, discussing what we will be doing to work on that before the break.
* We will break once every 45 min for 10 min pom.

## How we Work:   
* We will preform out work time on a group call using slack or if possible tuple.
* If we determine that a section can be broken into peices we can split the peices and keep on the call while we work individually.
* We will keep communication open. 
* We can work alone on experimental branches but will not push anything to master without refering to the group first.
* At end of the each day  we will have a retro that includes review of what was done, what to do next and check in with the dynamics of the group.

## Learning Goals:
* Josh: Would like to work on group dynamics, and utilize bubbling to have dryer code.
* Sue: Would like to better understand and code for the data model and DOM seperation.
* Tyler: Would like to understand group input and how to apply it in a more way that is productive to the work group.

## Branches and Commits:
* Branch name: `(feature-[initials]-[one or two word description)`
* Commit at end of any functionality.   
* Commit message is less than 50 characters but still desctiptive.
* Pull request language will use the template in the repo.
* No mergeing of own Pull Request.
